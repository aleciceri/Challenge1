README is good. Also, I've seen you largely employed git. Nice job!


Code Design
Important: I don't like the fact that you split each point in folders with different main functions and headers. 
   One of the main idea of the C++ is to have multiple classes of header files to handle each case.
   So, what I would have expected is a header file that instead of functions.hpp be name adam.hpp, or fd_gradient.hpp.
Hope you get the point, because this is very important to make good C++ codes.
  
  - pow is slow for integer. Should have used or a custom function or not at all pow.


Code could have been commented a bit more.

Overall the implementations are good: just improve on the code design.
